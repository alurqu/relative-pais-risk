Review of PAIS risk studies especially Long COVID relative to Long Flu

The spreadsheet file [literature-survey-post-COVID-PAIS-relative-risk.csv](https://github.com/alurqu/relative-pais-risk/blob/main/iterature-survey-post-COVID-PAIS-relative-risk.csv) contains a summary of the relative risks of cognitive deficits, dementia, other neurological impairments, and any post-acute infection syndrome (PAIS) after COVID relative to after other infections often but not always 2018 seasonal influenza.

A few of these studies did not provide direct numeric hazard ratios but still provided potentially useful information.

From the studies included, the risk of post-acute infection syndromes after a COVID infection does not appear inconsistent with other post-acute infection syndromes.
